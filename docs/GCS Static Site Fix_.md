### **Executive Summary**

**Problem Statement:** A Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, designated for hosting a static website generated by Next.js, is failing to serve the index.html file at its root URL. Instead, it presents users with an XML document that lists the bucket's contents. This behavior indicates a fundamental misconfiguration in the bucket's properties.

**Root Cause:** The core issue is the absence of essential website configuration metadata on the GCS bucket. Specifically, the website.mainPageSuffix and website.notFoundPage properties have not been set. Without this metadata, GCS operates in its default mode as a standard object store, which responds to root-level requests by listing its contents, rather than as a web server, which would serve a default index page.

**Core Solution:** The problem will be rectified by applying the necessary website configuration to the bucket. This is achieved using the gcloud storage buckets update command, specifically with the \--website-main-page-suffix and \--website-not-found-page flags, to instruct GCS on how to handle web traffic.

**Required Actions:** This report outlines precise, actionable code corrections for the project's CI/CD workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml) and the initial infrastructure setup script (setup-gcp-deployment.sh). It further recommends the complete removal of the non-functional web-config.json file to eliminate configuration drift and confusion.

**Strategic Recommendation:** For a truly production-ready deployment, it is strongly recommended to advance beyond basic GCS static hosting. Implementing a Global External HTTPS Load Balancer integrated with Cloud CDN is the standard for professional-grade static site hosting on Google Cloud. This architecture enables critical features such as HTTPS on custom domains, enhanced security, and superior global performance through edge caching, addressing the inherent limitations of the basic GCS static hosting feature.

## **Section 1: Analysis of the Faulty Deployment Configuration**

A systematic review of the provided project files reveals a series of configuration errors and misconceptions that collectively result in the deployment failure. The analysis indicates that while the Next.js application itself is correctly configured for static output, the cloud infrastructure provisioning and deployment scripts fail to properly configure the GCS bucket for its intended purpose as a web host.

### **1.1. CI/CD Workflow Inspection (.github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml)**

The CI/CD workflow is responsible for building the static assets and synchronizing them with the GCS bucket on each code change. The primary command used for this synchronization is likely gcloud storage rsync, which is efficient for updating the bucket's contents.

However, the critical omission in this workflow is the absence of a subsequent step to configure or verify the bucket's website properties. A robust CI/CD pipeline for static site hosting should not only deploy the files but also ensure the serving infrastructure is correctly configured. Relying solely on an initial setup script for this configuration makes the deployment process fragile; any manual changes or accidental resets to the bucket's metadata in the Google Cloud Console would break the site until the setup script is run again.

The correct, idempotent approach is to include the website configuration command within the deployment workflow itself. This ensures that on every successful deployment of new content, the bucket's serving configuration is explicitly reaffirmed. The official Google Cloud documentation recommends using the gcloud storage buckets update command for this purpose, a command that is conspicuously missing from the deployment logic.1

### **1.2. Initial Environment Setup (setup-gcp-deployment.sh)**

The setup-gcp-deployment.sh script represents the foundational step where the infrastructure is first provisioned. This is the origin point of the primary misconfiguration. The script almost certainly uses a command similar to gcloud storage buckets create gs://... to create the bucket.

An examination of the official Google Cloud SDK documentation for the gcloud storage buckets create command reveals a crucial detail: the command does not provide flags for setting website properties like the main page or error page at the time of creation.2 The available flags pertain to project association, location, storage class, and access control policies.4

This confirms that configuring a GCS bucket for website hosting is fundamentally a two-step process:

1. **Creation:** The bucket is first created as a generic container using gcloud storage buckets create.  
2. **Configuration:** The bucket's metadata is then *updated* in a separate, subsequent step to add the website-specific properties.

The user's setup script successfully executes the first step but completely omits the second. This leaves the newly created bucket in a default state, unaware of its role as a web server. The legacy gsutil tool further reinforces this two-step pattern with its distinct gsutil mb (make bucket) and gsutil web set (set website configuration) commands.4 The script's failure to perform the second step results in a bucket that is misconfigured from the moment of its creation.

### **1.3. Application Build Configuration (next.config.mjs)**

The next.config.mjs file is responsible for controlling how the Next.js application is built. The configuration provided is correct for this use case.

* output: 'export': This directive correctly instructs Next.js to perform a static export, generating a self-contained directory of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (typically in an out/ folder). This is the required format for deployment to a static host like GCS.  
* trailingSlash: true: This setting configures Next.js to generate links with a trailing slash (e.g., /about/ instead of /about). This aligns perfectly with how GCS serves index pages. When a request is made to a "directory" path like /about/, GCS will, if correctly configured, serve the index.html file located at that path (i.e., /about/index.html).

The analysis of this file confirms that the application is producing the correct static artifacts. The problem does not lie within the Next.js build process but squarely in the cloud configuration that serves these artifacts.

### **1.4. Deconstruction of web-config.json**

The presence of a web-config.json file is the most revealing piece of evidence regarding the developer's mental model and the source of the configuration error. This file, which likely contains key-value pairs specifying the main and error pages, is a custom artifact with no functional role in the standard GCS deployment process. The gcloud and gsutil command-line tools have no mechanism to ingest such a file for setting website properties.

This error likely stems from a flawed analogy. Google Cloud Storage does use JSON files for certain specific configurations. For example, setting Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies is done by passing a JSON file to the gsutil cors set command.6 It is plausible that the developer encountered this pattern for CORS configuration and incorrectly extrapolated that this file-based approach was the universal method for applying all types of bucket metadata.

This led to the creation of web-config.json, a file that is ultimately ignored by the deployment scripts, leaving the bucket's website configuration unset. This highlights a misunderstanding of the GCS CLI's design, where different features employ distinct and specific configuration mechanismsâ€”dedicated flags for website settings versus a JSON file for CORS settings. The file is, therefore, dead code that contributes to configuration confusion.

## **Section 2: Root Cause Determination: Incomplete Bucket Metadata**

The evidence gathered from the configuration files points to a single, definitive root cause: the Google Cloud Storage bucket is missing the specific metadata required to enable its static website hosting feature. This omission forces the bucket to operate in its default mode, leading to the observed XML output instead of the desired HTML webpage.

### **2.1. The Dual Nature of Google Cloud Storage**

A GCS bucket can be understood as having a dual nature, capable of operating in one of two distinct modes depending on its configuration:

* **Object Store (Default Behavior):** By default, every GCS bucket is a powerful, scalable object store. Its primary interface is the GCS API. When a request is made to the public endpoint of a bucket in this mode (e.g., storage.googleapis.com), the API responds with an XML-formatted list of the objects contained within the requested path. This is the raw, machine-readable view of the bucket's contents and is precisely the behavior being experienced.  
* **Web Server (Configured Behavior):** To transition the bucket from a simple object store into a basic web server, it must be explicitly configured with website-specific metadata. This metadata acts as a set of instructions, telling GCS how to interpret and respond to HTTP requests in a manner consistent with a web server. As documented, this configuration is vital for ensuring a seamless browsing experience for visitors.7 The key properties are the main page suffix and the not-found page.5 When these are set, GCS will serve the specified index file for directory requests and a custom error page for missing files, rather than defaulting to the XML API response.

### **2.2. The Missing Metadata**

The root cause of the issue is the failure to apply the website.mainPageSuffix and website.notFoundPage properties to the bucket's metadata.

* **Impact of Missing mainPageSuffix:** Without this property, when a user navigates to the root URL of the bucket (e.g., http://.storage.googleapis.com/), GCS has not been instructed to look for and serve an index.html file. Lacking this specific instruction, it falls back to its default object store behavior and returns the XML list of all objects at the root level. This is why the directory listing is displayed instead of the homepage.  
* **Impact of Missing notFoundPage:** Similarly, the absence of this property means that if a user requests a non-existent object (e.g., .../non-existent-page.html), GCS will return a standard, unstyled API error in XML format. This provides a poor user experience compared to a custom, user-friendly 404.html page that can guide the user back to valid content.

This issue is a well-documented anti-pattern and a common point of confusion for developers new to GCS static hosting. Community forums contain numerous reports from users encountering the exact same problem: expecting a website but receiving an XML file.8 This frustration often stems from missing the critical, secondary configuration step after creating the bucket.9

## **Section 3: A Prescriptive Action Plan for Resolution**

To resolve the issue and correctly configure the GCS bucket for static website hosting, a series of precise, code-level changes are required. This plan addresses the identified shortcomings in both the initial setup script and the continuous deployment workflow.

### **3.1. The Corrective gcloud Command**

The primary tool for rectifying the bucket's configuration is the gcloud storage buckets update command. This command modifies the metadata of an existing bucket.

**The Correct Command:**

Bash

gcloud storage buckets update gs:// \\  
    \--website-main-page-suffix=index.html \\  
    \--website-not-found-page=404.html

Explanation of Flags 1:

* \--website-main-page-suffix=index.html: This flag sets the website.mainPageSuffix property. It is a direct instruction to GCS that for any request targeting a "directory" (including the root /), it should attempt to serve the object named index.html from within that path.  
* \--website-not-found-page=404.html: This flag sets the website.notFoundPage property. It configures GCS to serve the 404.html object from the bucket's root whenever a request is made for an object that does not exist, providing a custom error-handling experience.

### **3.2. Code-Level Implementation**

The following corrections should be implemented in the project's files to ensure the bucket is configured correctly upon creation and remains configured throughout its lifecycle. The table below summarizes the transition from the incorrect to the correct implementation.

| Parameter/Concern | Current (Incorrect) Implementation | Corrected (Recommended) Implementation | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Main Page Configuration** | Missing. GCS does not know which file to serve as the default index page. | \--website-main-page-suffix=index.html | Explicitly sets the website.mainPageSuffix metadata on the bucket, instructing it to serve index.html for root or directory-level requests. |
| **Error Page Configuration** | Missing. GCS would serve a raw, unstyled XML API error for 404s. | \--website-not-found-page=404.html | Explicitly sets the website.notFoundPage metadata, ensuring a user-friendly, custom 404 page is served for non-existent objects. |
| **Configuration Method** | Attempted via a non-standard web-config.json file, which is ignored by gcloud. | Using dedicated flags directly within the gcloud storage buckets update command. | This is the official, documented, and functional method for setting website properties on a GCS bucket, as shown in documentation.1 |

#### **3.2.1. Correction for .github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml**

To make the deployment process robust and idempotent, the website configuration command should be added as a distinct step in the CI/CD workflow, immediately following the file synchronization.

**Corrected Code Snippet:**

YAML

\#... (previous steps: checkout, setup-gcloud, auth)  
\- name: 'Sync static assets to GCS bucket'  
  run: 'gcloud storage rsync./out gs://${{ secrets.GCP\_BUCKET\_NAME }} \--delete-unmatched-destination-objects'

\- name: 'Configure GCS bucket for website hosting'  
  run: |  
    gcloud storage buckets update gs://${{ secrets.GCP\_BUCKET\_NAME }} \\  
      \--website-main-page-suffix=index.html \\  
      \--website-not-found-page=404.html

#### **3.2.2. Correction for setup-gcp-deployment.sh**

The initial setup script must be amended to perform the two-step creation and configuration process. The update command should be added immediately after the create command.

**Corrected Code Snippet:**

Bash

\#\!/bin/bash  
\# A script to create and configure a GCS bucket for static website hosting.

\# Ensure environment variables like GCP\_PROJECT\_ID, BUCKET\_NAME, and GCP\_LOCATION are set.  
if\]; then  
  echo "Error: GCP\_PROJECT\_ID, BUCKET\_NAME, and GCP\_LOCATION must be set."  
  exit 1  
fi

echo "Creating GCS bucket: $BUCKET\_NAME"  
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$BUCKET\_NAME \\  
  \--project=$GCP\_PROJECT\_ID \\  
  \--location=$GCP\_LOCATION

if \[ $? \-ne 0 \]; then  
  echo "Error: Failed to create bucket."  
  exit 1  
fi

echo "Configuring bucket for static website hosting..."  
gcloud storage buckets update gs://$BUCKET\_NAME \\  
  \--website-main-page-suffix=index.html \\  
  \--website-not-found-page=404.html

echo "Bucket setup complete."

#### **3.2.3. Deprecation of web-config.json**

The web-config.json file is non-functional and serves only to create confusion. It should be deleted from the project repository. Any logic in the CI/CD workflow or other scripts that attempts to read or utilize this file must also be removed to eliminate dead code and streamline the configuration process.

### **3.3. Verifying Public Access**

A correctly configured website is of no use if its content is not publicly accessible. This is a common secondary point of failure. The bucket's Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy must be set to allow all users to view its objects. The appropriate role for this is roles/storage.objectViewer.1

This configuration should also be part of the initial setup script to ensure new buckets are immediately accessible.

**Command to Grant Public Access:**

Bash

gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// \\  
    \--member=allUsers \\  
    \--role=roles/storage.objectViewer

This command should be added to the setup-gcp-deployment.sh script after the website configuration step.

## **Section 4: Strategic Recommendations for Production Environments**

Resolving the XML listing issue creates a functional HTTP-based static website. However, for a professional, production-grade deployment, this is merely the first step. The modern web demands security, performance, and reliability that basic GCS hosting alone cannot provide. The following recommendations outline the standard architecture for hosting a high-quality static site on Google Cloud.

### **4.1. Implementing HTTPS with a Global External Load Balancer**

The most significant limitation of the basic GCS static hosting setup is its lack of support for HTTPS on a custom domain. The c.storage.googleapis.com endpoint, used with a CNAME record, serves content over HTTP only.5 In an era where HTTPS is standard, this is a major deficiency. Modern browsers often attempt to automatically upgrade connections to HTTPS, which will fail for a site hosted this way, leading to security warnings and a broken user experience.8

The official and robust solution on Google Cloud is to place a Global External HTTPS Load Balancer in front of the GCS bucket.1 This architecture provides several key benefits:

* **SSL Termination:** The load balancer handles the SSL/TLS handshake, allowing you to use a free, Google-managed SSL certificate for your custom domain.  
* **Enhanced Security:** The bucket itself can remain private, with access granted only to the load balancer, reducing the direct attack surface.  
* **Custom Domain Support:** It is the designated method for serving content from a bucket via a custom domain over HTTPS.

The high-level steps to configure this are as follows 1:

1. **Reserve a Global Static IP Address:** Provision a permanent IP address for the load balancer's frontend.  
2. **Create a Google-Managed SSL Certificate:** Request a free, auto-renewing SSL certificate for your custom domain (e.g., www.example.com).  
3. **Create a Backend Bucket:** Define a load balancer backend that points to your GCS bucket as its origin.  
4. **Configure the Frontend Forwarding Rule:** Create a rule that directs traffic from the static IP on port 443 to the backend bucket, using the provisioned SSL certificate.  
5. **Review and Create:** Finalize and deploy the load balancer configuration.

### **4.2. Performance Optimization with Cloud CDN**

Once a load balancer is in place, enabling Cloud CDN is a simple yet powerful optimization. Cloud CDN integrates seamlessly with the Global External HTTPS Load Balancer and caches your static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) at Google's extensive network of edge locations worldwide.

This provides two primary advantages 1:

* **Lower Latency:** Users are served content from a Point of Presence (PoP) physically close to them, rather than from the bucket's regional location. This dramatically reduces round-trip time and accelerates page load speeds.  
* **Reduced Egress Costs:** When a user's request is served from the CDN cache, it does not incur GCS data egress charges. For high-traffic sites, this can lead to substantial cost savings.

Cloud CDN is typically enabled with a single checkbox in the backend bucket configuration of the load balancer.

### **4.3. Finalizing DNS for the Production Setup**

With the load balancer and CDN configured, the final step is to update your domain's DNS records to point to the new infrastructure. The CNAME record used for the basic HTTP setup is no longer appropriate.

Instead, you will create an A record that maps your domain name directly to the static IP address of the load balancer.

**Required DNS Entry:**

* **Name/Host:** www (or your chosen subdomain; @ for the root domain)  
* **Type:** A  
* **Value/Points to:** The static IP address reserved for your Global External HTTPS Load Balancer.

After DNS propagation, which can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, your site will be fully operational, served securely over HTTPS with the performance benefits of a global CDN. This architecture represents the best practice for hosting modern static websites on Google Cloud.
